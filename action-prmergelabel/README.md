# ðŸš— PR Closed Labeler - GitHub Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that labels pull requests when they are closed as either merged or not merged ðŸš— .

## How It Works

This GitHub Action runs when an [`pull_request` event webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) is fired in your GitHub repo. The action checks if pull request was closed. If the pull request was closed and marged it applies the `prMergedLabel`. If the pull request was closed but not merged it applies the `prNotMergedLabel`. Note: if the pull request is closed but not merged and the branch is deleted before the action finishing running, the action run will be canceled.

## Installation

To use this GitHub Action, you must have access to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub Actions are currently only available in private beta (you must [apply for access](https://github.com/features/actions)) and only work in private repos.

To setup this action:

1. Create a `.github/main.workflow` in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `main.workflow` file and commit it to the repo's `master` branch.

```
workflow "PR Closed Labeler" {
  resolves = ["PRClosedLabeler"]
  on = "pull_request"
}

action "PRClosedLabeler" {
  uses = "waffleio/gh-actions/action-prmergelabel@main"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

3. Whenever you close a pull request, the action will run!
